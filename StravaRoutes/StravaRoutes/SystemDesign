Hello.

RADIO = Requirements, Architecture, Data model, Interface (API), Optimization and Deep Dive

Requirements:
- Display all the routes returned by RoutesJsonLoader
    - Every route should have name, distance, elevation, map

Additional customization:
-Display distance/elevation in meters or miles. Is the data in meters? I am assuming
-Display the type of activity

Questions to ask:
- Is the distance/elevation in meters?
- Should I limit the number of routes shown or do infinite scrolling? Pagination?
- Ability to post any new routes?

Non-functional requirements:
- Should I persist the data that I load on the phone? Or should I just do a fetch every single time we build the app.

Architecture:

Client:
RouteUI
    -Model: Route
    -View: RoutesFeedView which will display a list of RouteView
    -Controller: Fetch the users using the JSONLoader, and load it into the model

Server:
    -Provides the JSON data for routes
